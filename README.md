# Phoenix Council Elections

A web application for conducting council elections, allowing users to vote for council members and executive officers.

## Project Structure

- `backend/`: Contains the Python (Flask) backend API.
- `frontend/`: Contains the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frontend.

## Getting Started (Backend)

1.  Navigate to the `backend` directory.
2.  Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
3.  Activate the virtual environment:
    *   **Windows:** `venv\Scripts\activate`
    *   **macOS/Linux:** `source venv/bin/activate`
4.  Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5.  Run the server: `python app.py`
6.  The backend API will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Getting Started (Frontend)

The frontend files (`index.html`, `css/styles.css`, `js/main.js`, `js/api.js`) are served by the backend. Simply access `http://localhost:5000` in your browser after starting the backend server.
